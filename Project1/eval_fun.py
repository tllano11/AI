    '''
      Determines whether Dijkstra's algorithm has reached its goal,
      which is variant, or must keep searching.
      Example:
        Suppose it was given to us a hex board (formatted as a flatten matrix, i.e. a list)
        in which position number 10 is occupied by our enemy and we are playing as player 2,
        such as board[10] = 1. Therefore, the board's cost dictionary would contain:
        {..., (9, 10):Inf, (20, 10):Inf, (21, 10):Inf, ...} and there would be 120 free
        positions in which to make a move.
        The get_start_position(2, board) function would return '0', as it is the first possible
        position in which to make a move and "end" would be set to 10 (read the "evaluation" function
        for more details). Therefore, Dijkstra's algorithm would try to stablish the minimum cost path
        to get from start to end, returning "Infinity", as all costs from 10's neighbours to itself are
        "Infinity", and passing through 21.
        To avoid Dijkstra's algorithm to return "Infinity", "is_terminal_node" would evaluate whether 21
        is at the rightmost position of the board: ((21%11)-1) == 9? or not. It is, so "end" will be now
        equal to 21 and the minimum cost path would be returned.
